# A-Deep-Learning-Based-Chatbot-for-Young-People-Psychological-Health
The main aim of this project is to create a sentimental analysis model for chatbot called Ljmubot, this is a type of chatbot for cure young people psychological health by using the Artificial Intelligence (AI). Ljmubot can be capable of detect and decrease the negative emotions like depression, anxiety and loneliness etc..
Ljmubot can be capable of detect and decrease the negative emotions like depression, anxiety and loneliness etc.., If this type of psychological problems is become big, then those cause for a sever meager crimes and suicide issues. especially in younger generation this type of psychological health problems are high and need to be cure as early as possible. This the development of the entirely unique system by using the data from different types of surveys from internet about the children’s and young people psychological health condition, from the “Sorting Hat” survey on Pottermore.com, and using dataset from Kaggle to train the system [3]. 
The objectives of this research are as follows:
•	This technique could cause a huge benefit for the children and young people for improving their psychological health[1].
•	This system is a assemble of deep-learning based model, including LSTM, BI-LSTM and using of sequence-to-sequence neural network algorithm to cure the young people psychological problems[5].
•	Using text deep learning based text classifier to classify the emotions in the test
The main moto of this research is to prevent the suicides and other depression problems in the young people by using Artificial Intelligence (AI).
